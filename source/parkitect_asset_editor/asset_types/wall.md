# Wall

Walls are an extension of deco objects with the only difference that they can block paths.

Because walls are an extension of deco they share the same [deco settings](deco).

## Wall settings

The block settings will toggle which sides of the object should block paths. If that side of the object is placed between two paths, they will not connect anymore. A white cross will appear on the sides of a wall that are blocked.

**Height:** the height of the wall. Usually it should either be 1, 0.5 or 0.25 to match the games default walls.

## Wall size

Garret made a fancy guide on how to make walls fit with the rest of Parkitect.
