Some objects in Parkitect supports custom colors. You probably have used it before.

The asset editor supports custom colors if you setup your model correctly.

> Check [this](materials#custom-coloring) page on how to setup your model to support custom colors.

When your model is setup correctly you can enable custom colors in the asset editor. 
1. Check `Has custom colors` to enable support. 
1. Select the amount of custom colors your model has in the `Color count` field. 

After that you can pick the colors for your asset. Players can change the colors later but this will be the default value that will be selected in-game.
