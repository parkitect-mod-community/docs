Custom Color
============

Some objects in Parkitect supports custom colors. You probably have used it before.

The asset editor supports custom colors if you setup your model correctly.

> Check :ref:`this <material_custom_colors>` page on how to setup your model to support custom colors.

When your model is setup correctly you can enable custom colors in the asset editor.
1. Check `Has custom colors` to enable support.
1. Select the amount of custom colors your model has in the `Color count` field.

After that you can pick the colors for your asset. Players can change the colors later but this will be the default value that will be selected in-game.
